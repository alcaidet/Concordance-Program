# Concordance Program

This project tracks the count of each word in the provided .txt file using a hash map. The hash map is a hash table of  buckets, with each bucket containing a linked list of hash links. The word_count.py stores each word and its count in a hash  map, then returns a list of the top x number of common words. The user will indicate how many common words they would like to see.
